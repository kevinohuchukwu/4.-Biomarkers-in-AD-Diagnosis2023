# Investigating the Utility of Neuroimaging Biomarkers in Early Detection and Progression Monitoring of Alzheimer's Disease
## Introduction
This research project explores the predictive effectiveness of neuroimaging biomarkers, combined with demographic and genetic data, to enable early detection and progression monitoring of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Using advanced machine learning techniques and neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), this study aims to build predictive models that enhance clinical outcomes.
